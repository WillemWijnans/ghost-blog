I felt that it was time to have some more freedom and I recently saw some breathtaking Ghost blogs pass by. Simple, elegant and clean will be the motto for 2015 I guess. </p>

<h5 id="whatmakesitgreat">What makes it great?</h5>

<pre><code>So there are a couple of things that make Ghost much better than Wordpress. I will try to outline why this works for me.
</code></pre>

<h6 id="icanblogwheniamoffline">I can blog when I am offline</h6>

<p>So since I have been on the road quite a lot and I really like to write about stuff when I am offline and want to kill time. <strong>Read:</strong> while in airplane or at my current apartment (yup I have no internet in Atlanta). Just run a local instance of ghost by installing Node (and have some fun in the terminal as well), I get to live edit and see changes while offline and push it to Github pages when done. It's friggin easy. </p>

<h6 id="irunitongithubpages">I run it on github pages</h6>

<p>Github gives you the opportunity to hosts your own private site. Its quite easy to set up, but Github only hosts static pages and Ghost is not a static page. You need to use <a href="https://github.com/axitkhurana/buster/">Buster</a> to get this to work. It's really easy and very well explained <a href="http://talalanwar.com/host-a-ghost-blog-for-free/">here</a>. Also it gives my <a href="http://gitub.com/willemwijnans">Github page</a> some street cred (finally). Also the CDN of github pages is so much faster. <br>
<img src="http://willemwijnans.github.io/content/images/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2014-11-18-at-10-30-38.png" alt=""></p>

<h6 id="itsnotascloggyaswordpress">Its not as cloggy as Wordpress</h6>

<p>I hated the clunckyness of Wordpress, so much things to choose from and I did really only use 2% of it. Big overkill in my opinion. With Ghost I get the idea that I am using 110% of it's features and that feels good. </p>

<h6 id="looksbetter">Looks better</h6>

<p>This is subjective, but I like my current style more ;)</p>

<h6 id="itusesmarkdown">It uses Markdown</h6>

<p>Markdown is a markup language, so I can finally put some <code>code</code> in my posts and learn while I go.</p>

<hr>

<p>So, next up is the <a href="http://workable.com/">Workable</a> review. <strong>Sneak-peak</strong>: hired 3 very good engineers using it and there are 2 or maybe even 3 hires coming up. I am trying to release this baby somewhere late next week. </p>]]></description><link>http://willemwijnans.github.io/i-transferred-from-wordpress-to-ghost/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">9a3d9633-3dfb-409f-ae8e-31608af397c2</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Willem Wijnans]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2014 20:15:35 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Review of // Lever]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://willemwijnans.github.io/content/images/2015/01/Lever-logo.png" alt="">
A few weeks ago I promised a story about Lever, and why they should be used when you take hiring seriously. Today, I will talk about how Lever can help you doing better hiring. You know, the things that make you successful as a recruiter.</p>

<p>I got Lever on my radar when I read <a href="http://blog.alinelerner.com/review-of-lever/">Aline Lerner’s blog post</a> about Lever. She starts out with the exact same feeling I have been having for quite some time: ATSs suck big time. It doesn’t matter if you are Taleo, Jobvite, Jobscore or any other thing from <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ArG719HDHqXmdF9Db0lZaXVpbnZHTjRtMDNZcEVoeGc#gid=0">this list:</a> you kinda suck. I’ll tell you the one and only reason why they suck: they have no sourcing capabilities (and if they state they do, it’s a lie). The only two products who can effectively manage a pipeline of sourced candidates are Lever and Workable, period.</p>

<hr>

<p>So, first things first, if you are into sourcing talent, Lever can make it so much easier for you but also for your whole team. Their belief, and I totally back them on this one, is that everyone on the team should help finding talent. This is an invaluably wise thing to evangelise. Developers find better developers, period. Marketing guys can find better marketing guys and I can spot a decent tech recruiter from miles away. This product <em>can</em> get your whole team into sourcing people, instead of just dumping your roles with a recruiter who does not understand the role he is hiring for. They challenge the status quo, the central role of the recruiter / HR for hiring everyone is long overdue, and that’s what makes them such a damn good product to do hiring with in the first place. Lever will empower your whole team to approach the recruiting challenge together.</p>

<p>So how does it work? Like many other PaaS / SaaS products, they have a Chrome extension. This makes it easy to get peoples online profiles in to Lever (Github / LinkedIn / Angel.co / Dribbble). This thing is not exclusively available for recruiters, but for everyone on the (Google Apps) domain. That’s the power of it — you can turn your organisation in a sourcing power machine. I think this approach got adopted from how they work themselves and how many startups do hiring: hire with everyone on the team and make it fun again. At some point recruiting or just hiring new co-workers became a drag because it was so damn hard (and ruined by recruiters). With the right use of Lever and proper training of your team, hiring can become fun again, which it should be.</p>

<p>So that is the main reason I personally love Lever, but I also like it because they have some other aspects that are important. In no specific order: it looks good, it works, it gets updated regularly, it’s (partly) open-sourced and they are very nice people. Lets dig a little deeper:</p>

<h5 id="itlooksgood">It looks good</h5>

<p>I'll be honest and short about this: I like good looking things. It’s clever use of the modern web standards. It’s a good looking web application. UI is good, UX feels great and they often revise their looks to make it look even better.</p>

<h5 id="itworks">It works</h5>

<p>Like stated above: Lever has a really good integration tool, a chrome extension that lets you import candidates from sites like LinkedIn, Github, Angel.co, and they are integrating with even more sites as we speak. I already pointed out that Stackoverflow is a must have, as well as Bitbucket, Tech.pro &amp; Coderwall for tech and maybe Behance &amp; Dribble for design. I am not familiar with any other sites Marketing / Sales recruiters utilize, so if you know some that should be added to the tally do comment on this piece.</p>

<p>The tool just works. You install it and whenever you land on a page that Lever integrates with, you can scrape off a candidate’s (shown) information into Lever. It often gives you candidate’s email addresses as well, which is really useful when sourcing. Let me show it to you:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/ewsJ-800qWw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Next to the tool they provide a very good, but lean, ATS (Applicant Tracking System). Scheduling interviews is easy across the board, leaving feedback on candidates is done within seconds and all kind of reports can be made. You can tag people with specifics, there is a snooze button (❤) and you can use the open API to build a killer careers page. For instance, <a href="https://www.clinkle.com/careers">check out the careers page of Clinkle</a> — you can’t even see Lever anymore.</p>

<p>To be honest, hiring is a very administration-heavy job. This administrative aspect is the biggest pain point for me, but with Lever I actually suck less, which can only benefit the people I am trying to hire☺.</p>

<h5 id="theirsupportisgood">Their support is good</h5>

<p>Like with any other software, you sometimes need some support from one of their members, or if you are like me, you are missing things that would make the software even more interesting and therefore better to use. They take your requests seriously. ven last week when I visited them, they did a project called ‘Polish’ to fix all the minor issues and take user requests into production that were stacked over the previous period. Also I have seen many product updates in the limited time I have used Lever at 3DHubs.</p>

<h5 id="itisbuiltonopensourcetechnologies">It is built on open-source technologies</h5>

<p>Its all built on open source technologies: <a href="http://derbyjs.com/">Derby.js</a> (whom their <a href="http://sourcingmonk.com/wp-admin/www.linkedin.com/in/nateps">CTO Nate Smith</a> is an author of), <a href="http://sharejs.org/">Share.js</a> and <a href="http://tributary.io/">Tributary.io</a>. This gives them an advantage over all the big fish I named before. It will certainly make it easier for your engineers to start liking this software. Also they are currently building out their API’s: which for instance makes the custom build career pages possible. Check out their <a href="https://github.com/lever">Github account here</a>.</p>

<h5 id="theyareaverynicebunchofpeople">They are a very nice bunch of people</h5>

<p>Last week I had the opportunity to visit Lever HQ in San Francisco. They took me out to dinner, and we discussed the future, the past and the present of recruiting. As some of you might have heard, they recently landed <a href="http://citybizlist.com/article/211100/matrix-partners-leads-10m-series-a-for-lever">a nice Series A funding lead by Matrix Partners</a> so they are going to scale and push even a better working Lever into the market. This puts a smile on my face, since this market is full of ancient ATSs that need to be overthrown. Every single person I met is bright, young and driven to make their program succeed. You know you will be in good hands when you start using them.</p>

<p>So those are some things that really make my mouth water. It’s all subjective of course, but since I think there will be more people who will take on a pro-active way of hiring and could benefit from software built on those pillars.</p>

<h4 id="thecase3dhubs">The case: 3D Hubs</h4>

<p><img src="http://willemwijnans.github.io/content/images/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2014-07-21-at-18-17-05.png" alt=""></p>

<p><a href="http://3dhubs.com/">3D Hubs</a> is a startup from Amsterdam, they recently completed their <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/02/3dhubs-raises-4-5-million-to-make-local-3d-printing-global/">Series A funding</a> and are going overseas (NYC) to get more API penetration. The service they offer? They allow you to find and order 3D prints from printers in your area. It’s very cool for the 3D printing industry actually.</p>

<p>Now in this case that I am going to describe I had the luxury to hunt developers while using Lever. They needed Front-end (JS/CSS/HTML) and Back-end developers (Drupal/PHP). I did not even have to advise them on getting Lever, simply because their ‘Growth guy’ <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/robdraaijer">Rob Draaijer</a> had already implemented Lever long before my arrival (well done).</p>

<p>So, the overview screen is as follows:</p>

<p><img src="http://willemwijnans.github.io/content/images/2014/11/Overview-3DHubs-Lever.png" alt=""></p>

<p>As you can see it is my own personal pipeline. This is a snapshot of current state. You can see the underlined green sources. Though it looks like most candidates came from LinkedIn, this isn’t strictly true — I hunt people on Git / StackOverflow / BitBucket / Drupal forums or whatever and then import them through LinkedIn (if I can find their profile). Some guys only have AngelList or Github, and then I import through those sites. Note to self: <em>need to take care of specifying where I got people from, it seems Linkedin is doing an great job now while it I mainly use it for cross referencing or checking up on people (and importing them into Lever ;))</em>.</p>

<p>80 people archived, click it and see it in-depth:</p>

<p><img src="http://willemwijnans.github.io/content/images/2014/11/Overview-archived.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Most of the people have been sourced by me (27 leads, and in the archived slot there are the guys who withdrew etc), doing Stackoverflow searches (tag:Drupal and check out top-answerers in the EU area for them Back-end guys), LinkedIn searches and some Github searches.</p>

<p>The good thing is, if you are in to bulk emailing, you can send out a nice introduction email about the job and company, and why you think they are an added value to your mission. ONLY bulk email people who actually 100% MATCH to the job you are filling, and make it special. Do your research about the people you put in your pipeline. And if you are unsure, ask an engineer if the profile is good. Stop randomly spamming people with random jobs who match your random keywords, (there I said it again).</p>

<p>I always do research and make every introduction specific to the person. Ill give you one tip: it works pretty good to let the people know how you have found them, showing them your boolean search or X-rayed Github / Stackoverflow query and where they rank. I am not going to post screenshots about the emails I send, since I am giving away too much already.</p>

<p>Then, the beloved snooze-button ❤.</p>

<p><img src="http://willemwijnans.github.io/content/images/2014/11/Snooze.png" alt=""></p>

<p>So rule of thumb: no-one is looking for a new job at the moment you reach out to them. There are some exceptions but just know that this is a snowball game. The more you reach out, the more matches will be added to your snowball. Reaching out on a creative way also does some advertising work: Developer X to Developer Y: ‘I got this recruiter email the other day, it was actually personal and matching. Finally someone who gets it although I am not really looking. Oh yeah? What company? Oh 3DHubs, they seem a nice bunch’. etc etc. Word of mouth is still very powerful, especially in niche-recruitment projects. But let me get back to the Snooze button. The famous reply: ‘Not really looking right now, but I might be in ‘x’ months. BAM, snooze that guy for 3 months and he will pop up in your screen to be followed up upon then. So, when you do this frequently enough, people will start popping up in your screen all over the place, and that’s what I call the snowball effect of sourcing talent. The power is to have an active pipeline at all time, not to hire people now you needed yesterday.</p>

<p>So in the candidate profile you can schedule interviews, leave feedback, send emails, add or remove followers and check status. I was about to do like 20 screenshots, but why not make one video showing its power:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/JPSAHPNf7Ng" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Then their reporting tool is sophisticated. You can run numbers of reports so the data driven recruiter will have some fun using it.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, they have one engineer working for them who was solely focussing on data visualisation. The outcome is quite unique and you can definitely run a lot of reports with Lever:</p>

<p><img src="http://willemwijnans.github.io/content/images/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2014-11-03-at-11-31-47-1.png" alt=""></p>

<p>I do want to show you the Conversion Rate (beta) reporting tool, the one I like the most:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Km_4t4CNbjg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<h4 id="thenotsogood">The not so good</h4>

<p>Unfortunately, Lever does not come without flaws. There are some things that bug me. For instance, I am on currently working on a 13" Macbook and the overviews are hard to manage in such a small screen:</p>

<p><img src="http://willemwijnans.github.io/content/images/2014/11/Bug-1.png" alt=""></p>

<p>The candidate profile excerpt overlaps the pipeline ☹Posting your jobs to free job boards is not included and will most likely not be in. I kind of like that, since I don’t rely on people from these sources anyway. But for the enterprise businesses I can understand that this is a problem, as they would still get a lot of inflow on their (marketing / sales / whatever) jobs. Jobs on your job board do get picked up by Indeed, I believe, and setting up Glassdoor is easy by just adding the link of your careers site to the Glassdoor settings. All other free job sites: N/A.</p>

<p>Workflows can only be changed with help from one of their team members. I’d like to have freedom creating my own workflows per job, as they differ quite a lot.</p>

<p>I am missing a mobile application that lets me do things remote.</p>

<p>Sometimes bugs pop up, showing inconsistencies as having 5 people on snooze but instead lever is showing you the active candidates. A simple refresh (<strong>⌘+R</strong>) fixes this, but if it happens frequently I get irritated sometimes. Remember, Lever is still being built and they are on it when it comes to fixing bugs. (The project ‘Polish’ being one that addressed many of them).</p>

<p>One thing I think they can do better is showing how they do data-migration and on-boarding. The fact is the decision of switching ATSs is mostly with a member of the hiring team who will not use it as much and will always throw in ‘The fear of change’. They will come up with all kinds of BS not to change and stick with systems as Taleo, Jobvite or <em>insert any random ATS here</em>. The biggest one is always ‘losing their data’ or ‘training new members’. If Lever would put up more information about how they go about these topics, these so called decision makers would have no reason to stand in the way of change.</p>

<hr>

<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>

<p>All in all, if you are a startup and you are still using spreadsheets, give Lever a try. I have no doubt that you will like it. To get the most out of Lever, right out of the gate, get EVERYONE on your team involved in hiring / recruiting. If you incorporate this mindset from the beginning and embed it in your culture, you will reap the benefits later: a healthy pipeline on any job and people enjoying recruiting instead of dreading it.</p>

<p>For all you recruiters / hiring managers who are reading this and want to change from legacy stuff ASAP, do it. Stop giving your money to products that do not work or are hampering you hiring talent. Start using tools and embrace the fact of change, instead the state of fear.</p>

<p>So that’s about it, I do want to thank some people and products before I conclude this:</p>

<p><em><a href="http://alinelerner.com/">Aline Lerner</a></em>, for being such a kick-ass person when it comes to fixing tech hiring and introducing me to Lever through her original <a href="http://www.quora.com/Reviews-of-Lever">Quora post</a> where she reviews Lever. I really can not recommend <a href="http://blog.alinelerner.com/">her blog</a> and posts highly enough.</p>

<p><a href="http://evernote.com/skitch/"><em>Skitch by Evernote</em></a>, for making such cool tools to edit my screenshots and good old Quicktime to record screencasts☺.</p>

<p><a href="https://lever.co/about.html"><em>The team of Lever</em></a>, giving me the apparel to hike Clouds Rest and Glacier Point in Yosemite.</p>

<p>For building this product and for the nice lunch and dinner and time I had with them while visiting San Francisco.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, <a href="https://lever.co/jobs.html">they are hiring</a>!</p>]]></description><link>http://willemwijnans.github.io/review-of-lever/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">e0363233-aa65-4f3c-80bf-92081d8ea101</guid><category><![CDATA[Reviews]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Willem Wijnans]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2014 23:25:10 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hiring done right // Workable and Lever]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Since I did the <a href="http://sourcingmonk.com/talent-hacking-done-right/" title="Hiring done right // Talent Hacking">interview with Jobbox.io</a> I noticed how many people are interested in Talent Hacking. I have always been interested in doing things right with technology, especially the administrative part of hiring. It just takes very good spreadsheet management (where I fail miserably) or exceptional tools to do this (I like leveraging technology more). </p>

<p>So I am going to talk a little about the two tools / startups that have kickstarted me in any role I hire for. So meet my two friends, <a href="http://lever.co/">Lever</a> and <a href="http://workable.com/">Workable</a>. The latter is from Greece, the other is from the US. They are both good friends of mine, and they respect each other as well. But they are competitors to each other, as they both deliver an awesome product. They both give you a headstart when it comes to hiring tech talent. They are both equally cool, nice and helpful when I fill the funnels of the startups I am helping. </p>

<p>I mention them quite often here in the startup scene in Amsterdam. I can tell you they are my best friends when it comes to doing (tech) hiring right. Some time ago I introduced them to each other, by tweeting about them before a training I was going to give later that night. I like when two of my friends play to each other: </p>

<hr>

<p>Yet, they have many differences, one startup may suit Lever, the other Workable. It depends, like everything, but what makes Workable and Lever such awesome products for recruiting is that they want to involve everyone, from office-manager to head of development, in the hiring process. Because, they believe that everyone in the company has the ability to find exceptional talent, my friends Lever and Workable, enable this. </p>

<p>Added to that, they also both provide an Applicant Tracking System thats lean, has an exceptional UI and UX about it, has scheduling possibilities with for interviews, provide an open API and they partner up with other cool startups in the hiring scene to make hiring easier. And they deliver features on clients demands, which is cool. One thing is clear: both understand its all broken in the hiring scene and are willing to help fix it! </p>

<p>So, because there should always be conversation on good products, I will be releasing two blog posts with real-life use cases as I am using <a href="http://lever.co/">Lever</a> for the work I do at <a href="http://3dhubs.com/">3DHubs</a> and <a href="http://workable.com/">Workable</a> for the technology team I am currently building in Atlanta, Georgia for <a href="http://backbase.com/">Backbase</a>. I will start out with some basic info on how I met them, how I use them in my daily work and I will of course try to lay down a blue print so that you, yes you, can use these tools as well and make exceptional tech hires. </p>

<p>I will also be a critic, and talk about the bugs that sometimes pop up, but also I will talk about their customer service and how they go about fixing shit. Oh and for all the haters, I was not paid or asked to do this by either Lever or Workable; I am doing this simply because they make me successful in my job and kick the asses of all the other ATS's (Applicant Tracking Systems) out there. So stay put, I will start out with a post on Lever, as my work at 3DHubs has been completed right before my move to the USA. Greetings from Atlanta! <br>

<p>Every startup struggles when it comes to hiring. You need to get the very best if you want your business to be successful, but you have no idea where to find talent and you might not have the skills to persuade them and bring them on board. Startups live in a fast paced environment and the whole recruitment process, in most cases, slows down business growth. So how can you solve this problem? How can you find the software engineer you need to build your product? Well, that’s where <a href="https://medium.com/makeshift-studios/say-hello-to-the-talent-hacker-c8ae87db4a58">Talent Hacking</a> comes in.</p>

<p><strong>What is Talent Hacking?</strong></p>

<p>Talent Hacking breaks away from traditional recruitment methods (it’s about time), and invests in technology to tackle the hiring process. The concept involves finding the best people by sourcing candidates in different channels and by analysing useful data. A talent hacker finds the right people to hire by using unconventional tactics.</p>

<p>To find out more about it we have spoken with Willem Wijnans, who’s a Talent Hacking enthusiast. Willem is one of our <a href="http://www.jobbox.io/verified_referrers">verified referrers</a> and he’s the founder of<a href="http://sourcingmonk.com/">sourcing monk</a> and responsible for building tech teams at <a href="http://www.backbase.com/home">Backbase</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Willem, what is a talent hacker?</strong></p>

<p>In tech recruitment, things are going haywire. Companies have no idea on how to attract the best talent and the conventional recruitment methods are not working anymore. There are some smart people, who see this huge gap that needs to be bridged. Any person who wants to disrupt hiring in tech is in my eyes a talent hacker. So from a platform like <a href="http://www.jobbox.io/">JOBBOX.io</a>, to a consultant that advises companies to let their own developers do the sourcing of their new colleagues is a talent hacker. Just thinking outside the box (read not paying 20K+ for a random hire through an agency or hiring a recruiter to spam developers on LinkedIn).</p>

<p><strong>From your experience at Backbase why is talent hacking so important?</strong></p>

<p>For my company <a href="http://www.backbase.com/home">Backbase</a> it is of the utmost importance to use new tools to come to the best quality hires. Luckily for us, there are many startups who provide just that. Think about <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/work">HackerRankX</a>, who gives you a very easy way to test your developers to an innovative ATS (Applicant Tracking System) as <a href="https://lever.co/">Lever</a> or <a href="https://www.workable.com/">Workable</a>. They make it so much easier to do the most important bit in recruiting nowadays: sourcing relevant profiles. But, it also means educating hiring managers and interviewers. The traditional recruiting is not viable anymore. They need to get their hands dirty as much as a recruiter does. That’s why I am giving seminars to my developers at <a href="http://www.backbase.com/home">Backbase</a> on how they can source on <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stackoverflow</a> and<a href="https://bitbucket.org/">Bitbucket</a>. They deliver a nice pipeline of relevant developers and once someone gets hired they get a massive referral fee. Pretty nice hack if you ask me.</p>

<p><strong>What is the current problem with hiring and what tools are there to make it ‘easier’.</strong></p>

<p>The problem is that no one in a startup has time for recruiting. The most successful companies I have advised are the companies whose CTO is in the trenches with me searching for his next hire. There are all these nice tools that make recruitment easier, like <a href="https://www.talentbin.com/">TalentBin</a>, <a href="https://www.entelo.com/">Entelo</a> or <a href="http://www.gild.com/">Gild</a>, but they give a traditional recruiter a motorbike and he only has a driving licence for a car. He won’t be able to use these awesome tools the way they are designed to help and make recruiting easier. Startups however, use this one hack that very beneficial: the guy who KNOWS tech and KNOWS the business is doing the recruitment. Give him these tools or hacks, and hiring just gets so much easier. I have seen CTO’s hire with so much confidence once they were trained on how to leverage sites they normally use to push commits or search about tech related questions to hunt their new hires.</p>

<p><strong>Why is it so difficult for a startup to use traditional recruiting tools? Are these tools of any use?</strong></p>

<p>A traditional tool, if you can call it a tool, is for example an external recruiter. #1 problem: duh, cash. But these external recruiters are of no use at all, since most of them don’t even know what you need and why you need it. They give you some senior PHP developer when you need Ruby guy. Next to that, they spam the developer community, which gives your company a bad name. This is completely useless.</p>

<p>Another example is Job posting (good luck with that). Snowed in by everyone who still thinks that people apply. You are not Facebook, Google or Uber. You’re not disrupting anything yet.</p>

<p>Networking and asking friends might be worth it though. This still works sometimes, but I am not a fan of a biased hiring. In the startup scene this is the most common method.</p>

<p><strong>What talent hacks have you used in order to recruit better?</strong></p>

<p>In terms of services: I think <a href="http://www.jobbox.io/">JOBBOX.io</a> is nice and unconventional. I also used<a href="http://hiremyfriend.io/">hiremyfriend.io</a> although I did not hire through it, I partnered up with a lot of hacking founders who came across so many people but at the wrong time. I use that extensively as well. Then I am building my own service with two friends that makes searching for tech talent easier on Stack, Github &amp; Angel. Oh and not really a hack, but I like to include this when I hack for Javascripters: <a href="http://games.usvsth3m.com/javascript-under-pressure/">Javascript under pressure</a>.</p>

<p>In terms of my approach: I am trying to help startups I advise making the right decisions when they START recruiting (even better is to tackle this 6 months before they start). This being, planting the seeds of a good ATS (Applicant Tracking System), or a good info enricher as <a href="https://www.connectifier.com/">Connectifier</a>. Making them comfortable reaching out to people. For some reason people always perceive this a bothering. But turn it around, when you get a nice email about a relevant github commit or stackoverflow answer, how flattering is it that someone notices this and wants to work with you. Writing you an email out of the blue? I think that’s hacking pur sang, sending 5x emails to relevant guys/girls, instead of the typical recruiter crap (mass email to everyone who mentions javascript on their profile). And last, get your devs to help you when you have zero tech knowledge in your recruitment team. Make this an incentive for them, make them part of it. It works. </p>

<p><strong>Do you find the referral/reward system useful when hiring?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, but it needs to be constantly improved and marketed. When it comes to new hires, referrals are king in many organisation. Problem is, some companies think they can get away only with a referral system. They do approach this critical thing in referral hiring: “Why would employee X refer friend Y”? There are many companies out there better than yours, believe me.</p>]]></description><link>http://willemwijnans.github.io/talent-hacking-done-right/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">61cb4683-ec29-4b3a-ae7a-5adc2be7bb3b</guid><category><![CDATA[hiring done right]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Willem Wijnans]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2014 20:29:03 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tech-recruitment // It is broken]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>We have heard it often, tech-recruitment is broken. I do not have to rant about this since there are many articles out there that I have shared on my <a href="http://twitter.com/willemwijnans">twitter</a> feed. <a href="http://thenextweb.com/entrepreneur/2014/03/11/technical-recruiting-broken-4-ways-hire-better/">The next web has blogged about it</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/DannyCrichton">Danny Crichton</a> just posted about it on <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/07/27/how-can-we-make-recruiting-better/">TechCrunch</a> a few days ago. We all agree on the same thing, <em>something</em> is going fundamentally wrong. While all these articles go about how we can use new technologies and use buzzwords like big data here, <a href="https://medium.com/makeshift-studios/say-hello-to-the-talent-hacker-c8ae87db4a58">talent hacker</a> there and rave: 'we need good sourcers', I think we need to go back to where the problem really lies: <strong>'Tech-Recruitment is seen as a job anyone can do'</strong>. </p>

<h6 id="techrecruitmentisajobanyonecando">'Tech-Recruitment is a job anyone can do'</h6>

<p>Ok lets face it, most companies perceive recruitment as a thing anyone should be able to do and unimportant. How hard could it be, you have a job description with some buzzwords, you post it online and people apply because they recognise certain buzzwords. As I am writing this I am wondering how many companies are still like this, but from what I have seen and heard: really a lot. The more exotic companies have someone who can 'navigate' a site like Linkedin and search for talent there. While this is all good, most companies lack one very big thing in their recruiter: Someone with <strong>in depth domain knowledge</strong>. Let me build this out, in my line of work: <strong>tech-recruitment</strong>. </p>

<p>So, in almost all companies, the most junior of people get the task to do the recruitment. While I don't really care if someone is junior, senior or ancient, I do care that they completely understand the role that they are recruiting for. Most of the time, this is not the case. Especially in web technology, most of the recruiters are oblivious to what they are really searching for. 'Java and Javascript, they kinda look the same so they should be the same right?' and if you ask a recruiter the difference between backend and frontend technology, most of them won't be able to answer you. </p>

<p>So why is this? Why do companies allow this? You would not let your plane that brings you to your holiday destination be flown by a helicopter pilot right? The thing will surely crash: he has a basic idea about flying, but no idea how to work his way with a jumbo-jet. This is what happens all the time in tech-recruitment now a days, the guys &amp; girls know how to recruit (kinda), but they know jack about tech and they will crash a-lot (luckily without casualties). </p>

<p>How can they be with jobs then? Easy, LinkedIn has a way to spam people, so when you shoot out 100 iNmails in one go of course 3 of them will be relevant and matching, but you do not think about the 97 pissed of developers thinking: 'Again?!?' </p>

<p>For all you Dutch readers, a matching sketch of Daniel Arends came to mind when I was writing the latter, watch it here: </p>

<iframe width="702" height="394" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/ejUHDBIjRtg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>All this spamming from the 'tech-recruiters' can only have one outcome: really pissing off the developer community. I hear the following from my tech colleagues: 'They keep on spamming me on irrelevant jobs' and 'They call my Python repository nice while they are looking for a Ruby on Rails developer'. And this is totally valid, how would you as a recruiter feel if you get job offers regarding HR or Facility all time time? So whats causing these problems in my opinion? </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Cause:</strong> a crooked plane (LinkedIn) flown by helicopter pilots ('tech-recruiters').</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="solveit">Solve it</h5>

<p>So, the good thing is, its so easy to solve. Lets re-educate our helicopter pilots and train them how to fly a normal plane. The normal plane is navigating of Github, Stackoverflow, Bitbucket, Angellist, Tech.pro &amp; Coderwall (this is what I train loads of startups in Amsterdam). This will become easy when you learn how to code and know how computer science works. </p>

<p>So, all it takes is you willing to learn new things: some real basic computer science and a little fragrance of coding. Just to get a little grasp on what you are actually looking for and what computers actually do. Really, the interweb is FILLED with these courses that will give you the information you need to become a really good tech-recruiter. For all 'tech' recruiters currently reading, check this out (very high level): </p>

<ol>
<li>Start with <a href="http://codecademy.com/">http://www.codecademy.com/</a>  -- Just do their intro to <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web">Web Fundamentals</a>  </li>
<li>Then, get your computer science up: <a href="http://coursera.org/">Coursera</a> has a very nice <a href="https://class.coursera.org/cs101-selfservice/">Computer Science 101</a> course available  </li>
<li>TELL your developers that you are doing this, they will support you. If not: they no good.  </li>
<li>Do some specified Javascript, Java, Ruby, Python, Perl, Groovy, Grails, <em>insert your language here</em> classes on <a href="http://codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a>.  </li>
<li>When you are up and running, go online, dump Linkedin and go search on <a href="http://github.com/">Github</a>, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stackoverflow</a> and the likes.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="someothergoodsites">Some other good sites</h4>

<li><a href="https://www.edx.org/course-list/allschools/computer-science/allcourses">edX Computer Science lessons</a>  </li>

<li><a href="http://www.webplatform.org/">Web platform </a>(Frontend)  </li>
<li><a href="https://www.codeschool.com/">Code School</a></li>
</ol>

<p>Of course this is just my take on things, but I think companies who hire someone for doing their tech-recruitment without an idea on what web technology or software development is should go on a 1 month crash-course before you even let them touch a site like LinkedIn, not to speak of Github, Stack and Bitbucket. Thanks for reading and looking forward to any comments.</p>]]></description><link>http://willemwijnans.github.io/tech-recruitment-is-broken/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">ec098c79-4ab9-453d-ae08-e67cb79decd6</guid><category><![CDATA[tech-recruitment]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Willem Wijnans]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 01 Aug 2014 10:42:13 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Backbase // One month in]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Four weeks have passed since I joined <a href="http://backbase.com/">Backbase</a> as a technology recruiter and it has been quite the ride already. Since I have to ride my bike every morning for 7K, I pass the most beautiful scenery of Amsterdam. Sunsets, clear skies, the Vondelpark, the Amstel and loads of water. It's all quite refreshing to start your day seeing so much beauty, Amsterdam really is a lovely place to be working (and living). </p>

<p>For everyone who is landing on this page because I hunted them, check out this video to get an impression who we are:  </p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/dvK3JiEv1zg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>So the onboarding at Backbase was good, had a good introduction by my colleague <a href="http://nl.linkedin.com/in/wouterkoeleman">Wouter Koeleman</a> and got a warm welcome from my manager <a href="http://nl.linkedin.com/in/eveliese">Eveliese Luiting</a> and our HR officer <a href="http://nl.linkedin.com/pub/joanne-burgwal/5a/866/b44">Joanne Burgwal</a>. </p>

<p>Apart from my own team the whole team at Backbase are a smart and hard working bunch. They really believe in the Customer Experience Platform and it's nice to be surrounded by so many talented persons. Right in my second week we won the <a href="http://backbase.pr.co/70277-backbase-wins-best-of-show-at-finovate-europe-2014-for-its-new-omni-channel-digital-sales-and-enrollment-module">Finovate 2014 Best of Show</a>, which of course was a big achievement for the whole Backbase team, I look forward winning even more awards. On a personal level I am aiming for a <a href="http://www.glassdoor.com/Best-Places-to-Work-LST_KQ0,19.htm">Glassdoor Best Place to Work</a> 2015. </p>

<p>So what did I do this first month? Well, first I did a lot of searching, really, a lot. Backbase was having trouble finding <a href="http://www.glassdoor.com/job-listing/javascript-front-end-engineer-JV_IC1155583_KO0,29_IE117266.htm?jl=962342014&amp;paoIdKey=MA==">Front-End Engineers in Atlanta</a>, Georgia and my first assignment was to fill the pipeline. So I did what I like and do best: I went to my favorite channel <a href="https://www.google.nl/search?q=site%3Agithub.com+(Javascript+%2F+CSS+%2F+HTML*+%2F+jQuery)+%22Amsterdam%E2%80%9D+%E2%80%9Cpublic+activity%E2%80%9D+%E2%80%9Cjoined+on%E2%80%9D&amp;oq=site%3Agithub.com+(Javascript+%2F+CSS+%2F+HTML*+%2F+jQuery)+%22Amsterdam%E2%80%9D+%E2%80%9Cpublic+activity%E2%80%9D+%E2%80%9Cjoined+on%E2%80%9D&amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i58.5233j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=91&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=site%3Agithub.com+(Javascript+%2F+CSS+%2F+HTML*+%2F+jQuery)+%22Atlanta%2C+GA%E2%80%9D+%E2%80%9Cpublic+activity%E2%80%9D+%E2%80%9Cjoined+on%E2%80%9D">Github</a> (contacted them all so don't bother :)) for starters, did some <a href="https://www.google.nl/search?q=site%3Agithub.com+(Javascript+%2F+CSS+%2F+HTML*+%2F+jQuery)+%22Amsterdam%E2%80%9D+%E2%80%9Cpublic+activity%E2%80%9D+%E2%80%9Cjoined+on%E2%80%9D&amp;oq=site%3Agithub.com+(Javascript+%2F+CSS+%2F+HTML*+%2F+jQuery)+%22Amsterdam%E2%80%9D+%E2%80%9Cpublic+activity%E2%80%9D+%E2%80%9Cjoined+on%E2%80%9D&amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i58.5233j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=91&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=site%3Astackoverflow.com%2Fusers+Javascript+(Angular+%2F+AngularJS)+%22location+*+Atlanta%22+">Stackoverflow searches</a> as well and a nifty little Facebook graph search (see below). </p>

<p>Loads of qualified people rolled out of this and as we speak we got 5 talented Javascript gurus talking to our Principal Engineer, which for me is a good result. But next to the people who are being considered for the job, I have spoken to many other talented and qualified individuals. When reaching out based on content and real interest, the conversations gets so much better. This is the biggest reason I joined Backbase, because they see value in quality, not quantity.</p>
